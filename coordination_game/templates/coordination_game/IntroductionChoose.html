    Instruction: Second Half of the Experiment.
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

<p>
In the first half of the experiment, you have experienced two time environments:
continuous time and discrete time (with various numbers of periods).
In the second half the experiment,
you and your counterpart can select which time environment you prefer to play.
The payoff matrices are similar between games.
</p>

<p>
In the next following games, before you play each game, you can select a number from four options
to indicate how many numbers of periods you prefer to play the game.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Please select 0 if you prefer to play under the continuous time environment.
    If continuous time environment is selected, the game will be played in real time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Please select a positive integer if you prefer to play under the discrete time environment,
    where the interger you select is the number of periods you would like to play.
    Note that the total length of the game is 90 seconds, so the more periods you play, the shorter each period lasts.
    If discrete time environment is selected, the game will be played periods by periods.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
After you and your counterpart submit your choices,
the system will choose a time environment based on the experimental setting.
</p>

<p>
Please raise your hands when you are ready for the second half of the experiment.
